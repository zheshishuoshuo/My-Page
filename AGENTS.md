# Project Instructions

- Write all user-facing website copy in English by default, including page text, navigation labels, button labels, alt text, metadata descriptions, and JavaScript status messages.
- Keep the site lightweight and static unless a future requirement clearly needs a framework.
- Preserve source attribution for external scientific imagery used on the site.

# Stash

You have the `stash` CLI on your PATH. Run `stash --help` to see commands. Use it to read transcripts, pages, and history from your team's shared Stash workspace.

Your activity in this repo is streamed to that workspace, so teammates' agents and humans can see what you're working on.

## What a Skill is

A **Skill** is a *special folder* - one containing a SKILL.md - holding related artifacts (pages, files, tables) with its own access control and an optional public URL when published. Use one when you're publishing a *collection* of related things together - a project writeup with its supporting files, a research thread with its sources, a session transcript plus the files it produced.

A Skill is **not** a wrapper to slap on every single file you happen to share. One-item Skills clutter Discover and defeat the model.

## How to share things

- **One file your teammate should look at** -> `stash files upload <path> --json` and hand them the returned `app_url`. No Skill needed.
- **A folder / project into the workspace** -> `stash upload <path> --json`. Returns the folder `app_url`. No Skill created by default.
- **A curated bundle as one shareable thing** -> `stash upload <path> --skill "<title>" --json`, or `stash skills create "<name>" --public` to start a fresh one. Returns the Skill `url`.
- **A coding session (transcript + touched files)** -> `stash share <session_id>`. Sessions are inherently a bundle.

Run `stash prompts agent-guidance` any time you want this guidance reprinted in full.

## Browsing

Use `stash vfs` when you want to browse Stash like a filesystem without mounting anything into the OS. It accepts bash-shaped commands over the virtual Stash tree:
- `stash vfs ls /`
- `stash vfs "find /workspaces -maxdepth 3 -type f"`
- `stash vfs "rg \"query\" /workspaces"`
- `stash vfs "cat '/workspaces/<workspace>/README.md' | sed -n '1,80p'"`

## Common reads (all support `--json`)

- `stash sessions search "<query>"` - full-text search across transcripts
- `stash sessions query --limit 20` - recent events
- `stash sessions agents` - who's been active
- `stash files pages --all` - shared pages
